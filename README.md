# Empowering_tamilnadu
 The purpose of this project is to maintain the discipline and cleanliness inside the city using a website. It is hard for the management to look into every issue that arises inside the city. If the city has issues like electricity, water, drainage, road management, garbage and face struggle in maintaining. Empowering TN utilizes Automation, React JS, Application Programming Interface (API) and Cloud technologies to engage users to complain the fault, track live location of complaints for admins and track status of complaints for users. We added additional features of multilingual support, department wise admin and automated mail notification. The public users post complaints with geo-tagged media along with details. In our website we maintain a separate login for administrators of different departments. When the user posts a complaint in a specific department the complaint is only visible to the admin of that particular department. This followed for every city. After the issue has been posted on the website the intermediate person will check the complaint. The complaint also gets automatically notified to the particular department’s mail. The user can view the live status of a complaint like “Unseen, Seen, Ongoing, Rectified” on the user’s dashboard. For the admin to verify the complaint we added “Rectified complaints, Unrectified complaints” on the admin dashboard. For user safety we analyzed and added delete complaints only for users.
